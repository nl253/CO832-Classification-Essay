  - focuses on comparing the modified versions of traditional algorithms
  - long
  - comprehensive
  - many authors
  - not sure if from a peer-reviewed journal
  - 4.5/5

- A survey on measuring indirect discrimination in machine learning

  - very long
  - written by 1 person
  - definitely not from a peer-reviewed journal

- Borderline-SMOTE A New Over-Sampling Method in Imbalanced Data Sets Learning

  - about imbalanced dataset & ways of dealing with that
  - dealing with imbalanced datasets is discussed on the data and algorithm
    level
  - relevant
  - 4/5

  - peer-reviewed journal
  - very much about the bias *in* the dataset (class imbalance)
  - review
  - high quality paper
  - 3.75/5

- Considerations on Fairness-aware Data Mining

  - conference paper
  - highly relevant to discrimination
  - 4/5

- Discrimination-aware data mining

  - report
  - very long
  - math heavy

- Fairness-aware Learning through Regularization Approach

- Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets A Comparison of Various Strategies

  - old
  - seems to be from a peer-reviewed journal
  - very much about the class imbalance problem
  - short
  - discusses *how* to deal with the class imbalance problem

- Model-Based and actual independence for fairness-aware classification

  - from a peer-reviewed journal
  - long
  - by Kamishima
  - discusses a modification to Naive Bayes
  - accuracy vs fairness
  - 4/5

- Tackling the Poor Assumptions of Naive Bayes Text Classifiers

  - this seems to be the paper that introduced the Complement Naive Bayes algorithm
  - if so, then it's about the class imbalance problem and dealing with it
  - 2.5/5
